Wim Hof Method
=====================

>People think I like the cold too much.
>I fucking hate it, man. I do not like it at all! I like a warm hot place! I like palm trees! But I respect the cold. Very much. It’s my teacher. Merciless but righteous.

~ Wim Hof

**Controlled hyperventilation:** The first phase involves 30 cycles of breathing. Each cycle goes as follows: take a powerful breath in, fully filling the lungs. Breathe out by passively releasing the breath, but not forcefully. Repeat this cycle at a steady pace thirty times. Hof says that this form of hyperventilation may lead to tingling sensations or light-headedness.

**Exhalation:** After completion of the 30 cycles of controlled hyperventilation, take another deep breath in, and let it out completely. Hold the breath (with lungs empty) for as long as possible.

**Breath retention:** When strong urges to breathe occur, take a full deep breath in. Hold the breath for around 15 – 20 seconds and let it go. The body may experience a normal head-rush sensation.

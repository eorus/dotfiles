My personal machine is a 12 year old **Lenovo ThinkPad X220** that I'm running Arch with [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/) or [bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm). I still use it fondly in 2023 and I want to continue using until it leaves me. I'm trying to make the X220 as efficient as I can with [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) and WMs and related shortcuts. Especially in recent years, I have had a very comfortable and sustainable system by using command line applications. Presumably this is the same for anyone using any WM on Linux and customizing it and backing up the [dotfiles](https://github.com/eorus/dotfiles) configuration files, but for a machine with an i5-2450M processor, today's websites and traditional programs it can be quite challenging.

I bought [Thinkpad X220](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThinkPad_X_series#X220) when it first came out and used it for years. Then sold it and upgraded to the T470s to get a higher-end Thinkpad with a trackpoint, then to the X250 to be more compact. I think the X220 was calling me again :) After all, it was the same 12.5 screen and similar ergonomics, but something was missing (yes the keyboard and the blue enter key:). I had already set up a home server with a mini-pc, so searched for the X220 again. In 2019 I found a second-hand model with 8GB RAM and 240GB SSD for around $60. The battery was dead and could only work with the adapter plugged in. I spent another $60, bought a new 9 cell battery, installed additional 8Gb ram and replaced the drive with the 512GB ssd I had. And of course a dock station.

In summary, today I have an X220 with 16GB RAM, 512SSD disk, 4-5 hours of battery life, besides the possibilities it provides as a laptop, I can use full hd on a 25-inch monitor with dock at home. Let me briefly touch on the programs I use on the X220. Starting from here, I can then explain the details of some program with a "Uses" page.

I still think the Lenovo ThinkPad X220 is a great laptop to use in 2023 and beyond. Yes, it's not for everyone, but dealing with X220, Linux and [Cli programs](https://github.com/agarrharr/awesome-cli-apps) feels like modifying an old car in the garage and making it work today. The X220, like any other classic ThinkPad, is expandable, rugged, reliable, and provides everything I could ever want from a laptop. Of course, the most important of all is to observe that old hardware can be used more efficiently as time goes on, with [Floss](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/floss-and-foss.en.html).

If you are using an x220 and have anything to add or just want to comment, please feel free to email me. Thank you for reading.

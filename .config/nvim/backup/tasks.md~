So if you want to dabble in density training and want to program your own full body workouts here is a template you can use.

Plyometrics i.e. lunge jumps, squat jumps, box jumps

* Back
* Abs
* Legs
* Chest
* Shoulders

Notes:

Do 8 reps for each exercise and move on to the next exercise in a circuit fashion. Pick a weight that is your 15 rep max for each exercise. Set a timer for 25-30 minutes and perform as many set as possible. If you can complete 4 sets of each exercise add about five pounds for dumbbell exercises and ten for barbell exercises.

Skip a day between workouts. On the in between days do a bodyweight workout or a cardio workout of your choice. Keep it light and keep it fast paced. Overloading the muscles will only cause the density training workout to suffer tomorrow.

* Lunge Jumps
* Pullup
* Dumbbell Woodchopper
* Barbell Back Squat
* Dumbbell Bench Press
* Dumbbell Push Press

Hi, Iâ€™m **Alper**! I'm a freelancer, entrepreneur. I usually write and generate content as a **blogger**. I have several sites and large **camera** groups on the web. I write about **photography** and camera industry. In addition, I build websites or meet the digital transformation needs of companies in every sense. As a front-end developer i love to play with frameworks and create static and dynamic sites. In the past, I worked as a financial advisor.

Things I love (in no particular order) include Fujifilm cameras, Thinkpads, Sci-fi films, Running, Calisthenics, Linux and playing with CLI apps. By the way i use Arch :)

In the [Projects](/projects) tab, you can find some of the sites i've created as well as blog and social media works that I actively run. Feel free to [Contact](/contact) with me via email as i am not much active person on social media.

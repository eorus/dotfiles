I can also publish the current review in Turkish on the fotopedi.org website, which has a very high PR status. This will expand the interactivity of the current article.

> 3. I can publish a Meike banner in a certain area of the site for a monthly fee (or a yearly) If you are interested we can talk about the price details.
> 
> 4. There are a large number of Facebook groups with users connected to Dailycameranews. These are diverse for Canon, Nikon, Fuji, Sony and MFT. I also post ltheir inks below. If it will benefit you, I can carry out a marketing activity with regular posts on these channels for a certain fee. This is all up to you for a certain product or a campaign.

          <p>
           For AGS Soğutma, I've made the server setup, Wordpress and database installations as back-end development. As part of front-end development, I implemented a work on Skel framework that generally match the brownish colors suitable for the corporate look. </p>
         <p>
           I worked to include all content and products of the company on the site, and in addition, I've made the shootings of products photos.</p>

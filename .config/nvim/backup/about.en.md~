Hi, I’m Alper! I'm a freelancer, entrepreneur. I usually write and generate content as a blogger. I have several sites and large camera groups on the web. I write about photography and camera industry. Sometimes i develop websites. As a front-end developer i love to play with frameworks and create static and dynamic sites. In the past, I worked as a financial advisor. Things I love (in no particular order) include Fujifilm cameras, Thinkpads, Sci-fi films, Running, Calisthenics, Linux and playing with CLI apps. By the way i use Arch :) Feel free to connect with me via email as i am not much active on social media.
